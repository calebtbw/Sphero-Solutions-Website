          <p>
            Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract,
            including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
            termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
            International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
            Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146)
            according to the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring
            to it, is considered as the part of this clause. The number of
            arbitrators shall be three (3). The seat, or legal place, of
            arbitration shall be Singapore, Singapore. The language to be used
            in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. The governing law of
            the contract shall be the substantive law of Singapore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
            Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
            permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
            proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
            arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute
            to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of
            the general public or any other persons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the
            above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes
            seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of
            the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related
            to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of
            privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive
            relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
            then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling
            within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or
            unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
            competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction
            above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
            of that court.
